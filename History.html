    	<p>&emsp;The signs of the oldest settlement date back to the III millennium BC. In the middle of the first millennium BC The presence of the Iberian culture with the presence of Mycenaean remains is detected. The poblamiento of the environs of the urban helmet of Jódar is documented from the prehistory, being the deposit of The Quebradas, the oldest known, dated in the calcolítico towards the III millenium a.C.<br>
        &emsp;During the Middle Ages, the surroundings of Jodar remained intensely populated by various Islamic settlements consisting of several farmhouses and a refuge castle. The place name of Jódar is a matter of preamble origin, meaning its Iberian origin "forest mountain", which is derived in the Arabic Shawdar and that will Castilianize in Xódar, now Jódar, although other sources say that Shawdar is a name. In the 10th century it was considered an important urban center and was considered along with the current García as one of the main oil producers of Jaén. With the Muslims, Jódar, called Saudar, was capital for a time of the cora de Jaén. Converted into a political center, a large Mosque-Aljama supported by marble columns was built, surrounded by fertile orchards and gardens. An inscription reads: "If I hat biun alquim reibum, macale mion".<br>
        &emsp;Churches and public buildings are erected, and the esparto industry favors the prosperity of many of its inhabitants. A tragic event, however, will happen in 1520-1521, according to other sources: Jódar is assaulted by Alonso de la Cueva, who thus comes the death of his father Luis de la Cueva, Señor de Solera, at the hands of Señor de Jódar , Diego de Carvajal. As a result of this attack, the castle is burned down. Despite this, the Villa quickly manages to recover and continue its growth.</p>

        <p>&emsp;The seventeenth century, unlike the previous one, is a time of depression, which will remain during the following two centuries: secular hunger, forced migration and a terrible epidemic of plague that occurred in 1681 drastically reduce the population. The population reached double its number in the 19th century, which led to problems of overcrowding, lack of housing and lack of qualification in the workforce. Many families went to live in unhealthy caves, forming authentic marginal neighborhoods. Thanks to the new olive plantations throughout Spain that pull the esparto industry, the city is once again experiencing an unparalleled boom, which caused thousands of emigrants from all over Spain to flock to the town in search of a job.<br>
        &emsp; The nineteenth century was a difficult time. The shortage of land and the excess of population gave rise to revolts and disturbances. Jódar embraced liberalism, choosing in 1808 his first democratic City Council. Very close, in the so-called Cerro Luengo, Riego was defeated in what would be his last battle (1823). The Marqués-Conde de Salvatierra, owner of the town, is forced by a lawsuit in 1848 to give land to those who do not own them, although the successive defaults will cause strikes and riots during the following decades.<br>  
        &emsp;The final years of the XIX century and the first decades of the XX will see the arrival of the railroad and the construction of new and better accesses by road. With this new immigrants arrive to Jódar, which intensifies the problems derived from the lack of work and housing, despite the emergence of new neighborhoods. After exceeding the figure of 10,000 inhabitants, Alfonso XIII granted the Villa in 1919 the title of city and its City Council that of Ilustrísimo.</p>

        <p>&emsp;In the 60s of the last century, the emergence of new materials means the final decline of Esparto and, with it, the decline of the city. There is now a strong migratory exodus, which causes Jódar to lose population. Little by little, however, the various social policies have been eliminating the problem of marginal housing in recent decades, although there is still a high rate of unemployment and temporary workers, still to be resolved.<br>
        &emsp;Until the mid-eighteenth century, the production of esparto makes the economy of the neighbors flourish, becoming this the majority activity of the population for decades. From the end of the 19th century there was an active associationism, social movements and class struggles until the Civil War and the Franco dictatorship. After democracy, the movement was reactivated - with the Communist Party leading the way and its direction - and, although without definitive achievements, it contributed to the implementation of government policies of a social nature. The town tries to diversify the economy through the tertiarization and services, after the failure of the promised agrarian reform and not applied, and even today its main problem is precarious agricultural employment, lack of stability and unemployment.</p>
